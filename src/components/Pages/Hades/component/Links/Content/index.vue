        Ambrosia is one of several Artifact currencies that can be earned within
        the Underworld. Along with Diamonds and Titan Blood, they are a resource
        obtained via bounties. It is primarily used as a special gift for those
        who have deepened bonds with Zagreus. Most characters are eventually
        able to be gifted Ambrosia. However, there are a few who cannot: Bouldy,
        Hades, and those unable to be gifted Nectar. A few characters, upon
        receiving their first Ambrosia from Zagreus, will return the favor with
        a Companion. Ambrosia can also be used to increase the effectiveness of
        a Companion, giving it more uses per escape attempt. In addition, it can
        be used to purchase two themes - Lovely and Sonorous - from the House
        Contractor. A total of 10 Ambrosia can be traded to the Resource
        Director at various ranks to rank up.
